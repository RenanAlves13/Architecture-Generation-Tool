# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

ExamRush is a mobile application designed to help students study interactively through multiple-choice quizzes. The application allows users to create a profile, choose a question deck, and answer questions using both touch and the phone's motion sensor. The system integrates Firebase Authentication for user registration and login, and provides user profile management, including profile picture upload and cartoonization using OpenCV. The backend is Docker-based, utilizing Flask for the CRUD interface, MinIO for image storage, and MongoDB for data management. The application supports multi-user functionality, an interactive and animated UI, and utilizes the phone's accelerometer for navigation between questions.
