# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

Our distributed application concerns energy (electricity) management, both on the user’s side and on the energy grid level. 
The energy grid is the system that allows the distribution of electricity from the power stations to the final consumers. An important role in this process is done by the grid control center (we call it the central node). This structure manages the distribution of energy, in order to always ensure the stability and availability of energy. Each central node covers a certain area with the users residing in it. It is also linked to other adjacent central nodes, and (possibly) to a power station.
A crucial element in the energy grid system are the energy storages, since they allow storage of energy for later use; this improves the stability of the system. Usually they are batteries or some other similar method of storing energy. 

*Objectives*

optimize energy distribution: our application has to be able to manage correctly and efficiently the energy used and produced by each of its users, control the limits of consumption and send energy to the users.
enhance user control and awareness : our aim is to improve the user's ability to manage and effectively understand their energy usage. We want to implement features that allow users to actively monitor their energy consumption, providing detailed insights and controls. By enhancing user control and awareness, the goal is to enable individuals to make informed decisions about their energy usage, promoting efficiency and sustainability.
promote energy sharing and collaboration between users: one of the purposes of this application is to encourage the sharing of energy resources and to foster collaboration among users: this will be possible by creating a system where they can seamlessly buy and sell energy between themselves. In this way we are allowing users to efficiently meet their energy needs through mutual cooperation by shaping a more interconnected and sustainable energy ecosystem.
encourage sustainability: we want to educate and suggest sustainability and economical advice in order to encourage the transition to a greener economy, without wasting energy, so the application will have a personalized section concerning this topic.

*What our system should do*

Energy monitoring: Each user will have a detailed view on her/his own energy balance, regarding both consumption and production, they can access a dashboard containing statistics and charts showing energy consumption of the user from various sources (if more than one) through time. The user will receive notifications in case she/he is consuming above the limit, in fact each user will have a capacity limit that can be set or can have a default value. This is done to avoid wasting energy or overloading the network.
Energy bill: The user is able to choose the most preferred between different energy providers which serve his/her central node, by consulting and comparing them in a list. The application will send energy bills to the user according to their energy consumption and their provider fees. This is done only for the energy coming from the central node without considering exchanges with other users, which will be paid directly at the moment of transaction. 
Energy trading: The users will be able to easily trade energy between themselves (through the central node) or directly to the central node. The users can sell their produced energy to the central node whenever they want, if the central node capacity is not already full. They can buy extra-energy (other than the one they are already being provided with) directly from the central node without specifying the source seller. 
Energy storage and saving: In order to avoid any waste of energy, the user can monitor the amount of energy in her/his own deposit/storage if present. 
Energy management: Our application allows the central node (grid control center) to efficiently manage the distribution of energy among all users in the grid, in such a way that each user can satisfy her/his request.  The application will provide a dashboard with the current status of all the users that are served by the central node, and also the application will monitor and manage the central storage capacity which contains energy to be sold to users. Also the central node should monitor its storage capacity and energy production.
Sustainability: The user can choose whether to receive personalized advice for energy saving (and sustainability), this allows the user to reduce her/his spending and also to be environmentally friendly. In fact the user can choose what will be her/his sources of energy since they often are not specified in the contracts (renewable or traditional).

## CONTAINER_NAME: bills_provider_service

### DESCRIPTION: 
Handles bill generation, payment processing, and provider selection.

### USER STORIES:
12) As a user, I want to receive energy bills sent by the central node based on my provider’s rates and my consumption, so that I can track my expenses.
15) As a user, I want to compare different energy providers within my central node, so that I can choose the most convenient and sustainable option.
16) As a user, I want to insert/update my current provider contract, so that I can adjust my account to fit my changing energy needs.
17) As a user, I want to access a history of my past energy bills, so that I can review my previous payments and budget accordingly.
19) As a user, I want to select my energy source (renewable or traditional) when signing up with a provider, so that I can align my consumption with my sustainability goals.

### PORTS: 
4004:4004

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION
The provider selection and billing service requires persistent storage to support user-specific energy service tracking. It stores details about each user’s selected energy provider, including energy type, cost, consumption plan, and custom description, in the Selected_provider table. All energy bills are persistently recorded with data like trimester, amount, consumption, provider ID and name, and whether the bill has been paid, stored in the Bill table. Additional relational data links users to their properties and central nodes. Notifications about consumption limits are stored and deduplicated to avoid spam. This persistence ensures that provider selections, billing records, and personalized consumption alerts are consistently available across sessions and navigations, enabling reliable comparison, payment, and tracking of energy use.

		- search.js fetches and filters provider data;
		- insert_provider.js handles provider selection/change and form submission;
		- comparison.js displays side-by-side provider comparisons using localStorage;
		- bill.js retrieves, displays, filters, and redirects for payment of user bills;
		- provider.js and my_provider.js verify and render the user’s current provider;
	- a Node.js backend (server.js) built with Express, exposing endpoints for provider retrieval (/get-providers), bill management (/get-bills), contract registration (/select-provider), user and node information, and provider data.
	- persistent data fetched from a PostgreSQL database via pg, where key entities include Bill, Selected_provider, Energy_provider, Notifications, and user-linked tables like Property and Person.
	- integration with a session-based system and cookie parsing (through navigation.js and extractUserId()) to maintain user context across pages and services.
	- logic that conditionally renders interface elements and redirects users (e.g., showing “Insert your provider” if none is found), and supports navigation actions like to_bill() or to_my_provider() programmatically across all pages.

- SERVICE ARCHITECTURE: 
The service is realized with:
	- three primary HTML interfaces: dashboard.html for data visualization and tips, my_devices.html for device management, and notification.html for user alerts.
	- modular JavaScript files:
		- dashboard.js handles energy consumption statistics, visualizations (doughnut/bar charts via Chart.js), and provider info
		- my_devices.js enables insertion and deletion of devices linked to a user's property
		- notification.js fetches and filters alerts (e.g., overconsumption)
		- navigation.js provides global route management and navbar updates
	- a Node.js backend (server.js) using Express, with endpoints to serve static HTML and retrieve data from PostgreSQL via pg.
	- database interaction covering Device, Consumption, Notifications, and Selected_Provider, with real-time aggregation of consumption per device and month.
	- a client-server contract for filtering notifications by date, dynamically updating dashboards with charts, and auto-generating device tables and alerts.
	- contextual rendering tied to the logged-in user via cookie parsing (logged=) to personalize views and data fetches.

## CONTAINER_NAME: central_node_service

### DESCRIPTION: 
Manages grid-level energy distribution, node registration, and admin functionality.

### USER STORIES:
2) As a central node manager, I want to register a new central node and link it to providers and users, so that I can ensure proper energy distribution.
10) As a central node manager, I want to monitor the real-time energy usage of all users in my grid, so that I can efficiently distribute energy and maintain grid stability.
13) As a central node manager, I want to be able to see the energy storage levels within my grid, so that I can ensure energy availability during peak demand.

### PORTS: 
4000:4000

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION
The central node service requires persistent storage to manage energy infrastructure data and monitor user consumption. It stores the location, capacity, and current energy levels of each node, the associated energy providers, and real-time deposit information. User consumption data over time is collected and used to compute bills, which are stored alongside relevant provider and pricing details. Alerts for overuse or shortages are generated and saved to notify administrators. This persistent data ensures continuous monitoring of the energy grid, traceability of usage patterns, and automated billing and alerting for provincial users linked to a central node.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
This container does not connect to any external service.
