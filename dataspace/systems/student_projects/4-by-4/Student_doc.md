# CONTAINERS:

## CONTAINER_NAME: db

### DESCRIPTION:
The db container hosts a PostgreSQL database that stores all persistent data for the 4-by-4 platform. It manages user accounts, game statistics, challenges, and other relevant data. The database is initialized with tables for users, games, and challenges, and it is accessed by both the web and websocket containers for data retrieval and storage.

### USER STORIES:
2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

### PORTS:

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION
The db container is responsible for persistent data storage. All user accounts, game histories, and challenges are stored in the PostgreSQL database. Data persists across container restarts and deployments, ensuring continuity for users.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
None. The db container is only accessed internally by the web and websocket containers.

### MICROSERVICES:

## CONTAINER_NAME: redis

### DESCRIPTION:
The redis container provides session storage for all PHP pages, enabling efficient session management across the 4-by-4 platform. It helps in maintaining session persistence, reducing database load, and improving response times by storing temporary session data in memory.

### USER STORIES:
The redis container is indirectly involved in almost all user stories, because session storage is used troughout the webiste troughout navigation.

### PORTS:
Redis default port: 6379 (internal use only, not exposed externally).

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION:
The redis container stores session data temporarily. It is not responsible for long-term data persistence, as session data is volatile and cleared upon container restarts.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS:
- Communicates with the web and websocket containers for session management and caching.

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: Session Storage Service
