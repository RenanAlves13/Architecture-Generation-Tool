# ChoronoPic Documentation

## 🧠 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

ChronoPic is a photo management platform where users can upload images and automatically tag them based on age detection and optionally known persons. The system provides asynchronous processing using computer vision (face & age detection), and supports secure user authentication. Users can view, filter, and manage their personal image collections based on metadata and detection results.
